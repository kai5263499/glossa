glossa is the greek word for language. The goal of this language is to help chat ops systems take a string that specifies a set of keywords and variables and translate that into a regular expression with capture groups that corersponds to the specification. I wrote this to help with two related applications. One was a Slack bot where I wanted the ability to change variables within the bot and the other was to parse through text that had been converted from speech and respond to commands.
